## Description

My sister works for a tutoring company that has been utilizing Canvas and Zoom to give lessons. She wants a landing page with integration into Canvas

## Challenges I Anticipate

I've never worked with the Canvas API, I also need to discuss with them how much data they want on their site. (Ex: Just an emailing list, to aggregation of kids work based on name/subject/etc). I'm new to DevOps, so I need to show them pricing for server uptime alone.

## Skateboard

Create a landing page that adds people to a mailing list.

## Bike

CRUD Canvas, specifically new courses.

## Car

CRUD students, teachers, and maybe grades???

## Beyond

- Make website UI/UX modern (not bootstrapped)
- Add on site Scratch IDE with a tutorial
- Learning Games maybe?

## Personal Achievement Goals:

1. Gain skill in API integrations
2. Learn how to interpolate client requests into a product
3. Expand knowledge on more complex databases.
